Step 1: Decide What Your Match Score Represents

Before adding fields, answer this:

Is your match % about:
A Cultural compatibility
B Lifestyle compatibility
C Long-term value alignment
D Family expectations
E All of the above?

If you try to do everything at once, the percentage becomes meaningless.

Step 2: Structure Preferences Into 4 Buckets

Instead of “adding more fields,” think in dimensions.

1️⃣ Demographic Compatibility (Low Emotional Weight)

Age

Height

Location

Marital status

Weight: 25%

2️⃣ Cultural Compatibility (Very High in Indian Matrimony)

Religion

Caste

Mother tongue

Family type (joint / nuclear)

Family values (traditional / moderate / liberal)

Weight: 30%

This is extremely important if you're competing with platforms like
Bharat Matrimony
because they dominate on cultural filters.

3️⃣ Education & Career Compatibility

Education level

Profession category

Income range

Work location stability (abroad plans?)

Weight: 20%

Career mismatch causes real friction in marriages. This matters.

4️⃣ Lifestyle & Personality Compatibility (This is your differentiation)

Here is where you can be smarter than traditional matrimony platforms:

Add:

Smoking / Drinking

Food preference (Veg / Non-veg / Eggetarian)

Fitness importance

Spirituality importance

Ambition level

Children preference (Yes / No / Flexible)

Career after marriage preference (especially important for women profiles)

Openness to relocation

Weight: 25%

This is where psychological-based matchmaking can actually work.

But be careful:
Don’t add 50 questions.
Add 8–12 meaningful ones.

Step 3: Make Match % Transparent

Right now it just shows 86%.

That’s decorative.

Instead, show:

Compatibility Breakdown:

Cultural: 90%

Lifestyle: 70%

Career: 80%

Location: 85%

Now it feels intelligent.

Step 4: Don’t Over-Filter Supply

Important strategic warning:

If you allow too many strict filters:

Users narrow to 0 results

Women profiles get overloaded

Marketplace imbalance worsens

So separate:

Hard filters (must match)
Soft preferences (increase score but not required)

That is how real matchmaking systems work.

Step 5: Keep Algorithm Simple Internally

Don’t over-engineer AI right now.

Basic weighted scoring works:

Example:

Match Score =
(Weight1 × MatchRatio1) +
(Weight2 × MatchRatio2) +
(Weight3 × MatchRatio3) +
(Weight4 × MatchRatio4)

Even Excel-level logic is enough at this stage.

You do not need machine learning.

You need clarity + trust.
