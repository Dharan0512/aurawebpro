# ✅ What You Currently Have (Foundation Layer)

These are operational basics:

- [ ] User Registration
- [ ] User Login
- [ ] View Profile
- [ ] Edit Profile
- [ ] Dashboard
- [ ] Filter Matches

**This = searchable database.**  
It does NOT yet create emotional engagement.

# 🔴 What’s Missing (Core Interaction Layer)

Without these, users browse and disappear.

---

## 1️⃣ Interest System (Mandatory)

- [ ] Send Interest button
- [ ] Accept / Reject flow
- [ ] “Interest Sent” state
- [ ] “Interest Received” section
- [ ] Notification when interest is received
- [ ] Timestamp (when interest was sent)

**Why this matters:**  
Interest = emotional movement.  
It converts passive browsing into active intent.

---

## 2️⃣ Interaction Control Logic

You need clear communication rules.

Choose one model and implement fully:

### Option A – Acceptance Unlock

- [ ] Messaging enabled only after interest accepted
- [ ] Chat UI
- [ ] Message notification

### Option B – Premium Contact Unlock

- [ ] Contact number hidden by default
- [ ] Only paid users can view contact
- [ ] Clear paywall message
- [ ] Contact view tracking

Right now your model suggests Option B.  
That’s fine — but it must feel valuable.

## 3️⃣ Monetization Triggers (Upgrade Psychology)

Don’t just show “Upgrade to Gold” at top-right.

Add:

- [ ] “Someone viewed your profile” (blurred name for free users)
- [ ] “3 people sent interest to you” (blur details for free users)
- [ ] Limited profile views per day
- [ ] Highlight premium badge on paid users
- [ ] Boost profile visibility option

People don’t pay for features.  
They pay to avoid missing opportunities.

---

## 4️⃣ Trust Infrastructure (Conversion Layer)

If trust is weak, no one pays.

- [ ] Mobile OTP verification badge
- [ ] Profile approval by admin
- [ ] Mandatory profile photo
- [ ] Active status (Online today / Active 3 days ago)
- [ ] Report / Block option

You are competing psychologically with large matrimony platforms.  
You cannot outspend them.  
You must feel safer and more genuine.

---

## 5️⃣ Profile Strength Indicator

- [ ] Profile completion percentage
- [ ] Prompt to add missing details
- [ ] Visibility boost for 80%+ profiles

Incomplete profiles destroy response rates.

---

## 6️⃣ Marketplace Density Strategy

Before scaling ads:

- [ ] At least 100–150 active profiles in ONE city
- [ ] Balanced gender ratio
- [ ] At least 10–15 daily active users
- [ ] 5+ interest exchanges per day

Without this, ads = money burn.

# 📊 Revenue Readiness Checklist (For ₹1L/Month Target)

If plan price = ₹1,999

- [ ] Can you generate 1,000 signups?
- [ ] Do you have 300 real, active profiles?
- [ ] Are at least 100 interactions happening monthly?
- [ ] Do users feel urgency to upgrade within 7 days?
